Incident report applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to a DDoS scenario
# Network Incident Report – NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

This repository contains a cybersecurity incident report created as part of my professional training. The report analyzes a simulated distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack using the five core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):

- **Identify**
- **Protect**
- **Detect**
- **Respond**
- **Recover**

The scenario involved a multimedia company impacted by a flood of ICMP packets. The report outlines how the organization handled the attack and how it improved its security posture moving forward.
